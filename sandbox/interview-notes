1.  summarize the question - write key points on the whiteboard
2.  clarify, narrow the scope of what you are doing
3.  Minimum Viable Product: simple quick solution first.
4.  then expand on that solution with any more complex solution.

	- don't explain simple things
	- focus on explaining design decisions (rather than coding)
	- draw a visual representation of what your design is doing [e.g. in a "toolbox" you put program elements in ... ]
	- work collaboratively with the interviewer (they want to see you succeed);

	**********TIPS************
	bring your own thin tip markers
	start to write code in the top left corner (to give yourself space)
	PRACTICE writing code on a 
	REVIEW witeboarding 101 W2D2


	getPrice(discount) - 

===== natural to gravitate toward what you are comfortable doing, rather than what is necessary.  e.g. in the example Reno started jumped into coding - before clarifying.  



EXAMPLE:  STOREKEEPER, SELLS BAKED GOODS, WANTS SOMETHING THAT WILL TELL HIM WHEN TO SELL GOODS AT REDUCED PRICE:

Q:  which days are you offering discounts?
		Wednesday: coffee 20%
		Thursday: coffee 30%
		Sunday: donuts 50%

Q: what do you sell:
		coffee  $2
		donuts 	$1.50
		tea		$4

whiteboard:

	pseudocode:  I have an item, what does it cost
				I have a bunch of items what do they cost

				 each design program should be 
				 use get(day) then pass result into get(price)
				 
				 user figures out what they want, progrma figures out what day it is, and what the price is.


				  for each "product" 
				* single item price 
				* applicable discount
				* number of items
			

		(list of objects)
		var cart = {
			coffee: 3,
			donuts: 12,
			function checkout(cart)
		}

		var listOfAllProducts = [coffee, tea, donuts];

		function getPrice(item) {
			Switch(item) {
				case "coffee":
					return $2.00
				case "donuts":
					return $1.50
				case "tea":
					return $4.00
			}
		}


"can you think of a better way to desgn that?"
"how would I ring up multiple items, e.g. 10 coffee's"
