MDP -  minimum deliverable product - the simplist prototype to present.
	Id the prob
	conceptualize the end product
	break it down; and,
	start small


	shuffle a deck of cards:

	0.  roll the die to determine # of card shuffles.
	1.  roll the die;
	2.  if the die lands 1,2 swap 7 with 8;
	3.  if the die lands 3,4 swap 7 with 8;
	4.  if the die lands 5,6 swap 7 with 9;
	5.  if the die lands 1,2 swap 8 with (the card in the first spot)
	6.  if the die lands 3,4 swap 8 with (the card in the second spot)
	7.  if the die lands 5,6 swap 8 with (the card in the third spot)
	8.  if the die lands 1,2 swap 9 with (the card in the first spot)
	9.  if the die lands 3,4 swap 9 with (the card in the second spot)
	10.  if the die lands 5,6 swap 9 with (the card in the third spot)

	there are 3*3*3=27 possibile routes.
	there are 6 possible outcomes.
	6 doesn't go into 27 evenly - consequently and equal probability of outcome is not possible.

	the initial order of the cards affect the outcome.

	PROBLEM SOLVING:

	decomposing - break it into pieces. 
	pattern recognition
	abstraction
	algorithm design
