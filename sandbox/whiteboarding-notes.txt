whiteboarding for interviews:

practice writing on a whiteboard - legible writing - straight lines; practice talking while writing)

keep talking as you walk through the problem.
ask questions: start with is the question in "ascii" - [look this up]
"may I assume ..." (if there is no most common letter, the letter that comes last in the alphabet)
give examples of what your code should do before you start writing code;
do medium and high pseudocode
use an array of 3 or 4 numbers (0,1,2,3), or words that are short (dog, beer)

[check "code wars" for whiteboard challenges]

1.  write a function to determine the most common letter.

	- grab the word to be parsed
	- go through each letter 
	-store +1 for each occurance;
	-compare the # of occurances for each letter;

		-if there is a greater occurance - return the letter;
	
		-if there is not a greater- compare the letter to alphanumeric key
		-return highest numeric value and equivalent letter.
