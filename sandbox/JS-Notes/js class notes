JS - keep the JS on the bottom ... for now

var  - variable
+
myName
=
"bowman neely" (you don't need quotes for numbers)
;

strings, numbers, ...


1.  link html to JS

 <script src="script.js"></script>

make objects in js with properties (key 'name' vlaue, name, favoriteFood, zip) signified by "keys".

you can add properties with the object name and new [var] key value

run js in the browser inspect element console - 

exponents:  console.log(Math.pow(3,2))  [three to the second power]

console.log(Math.random() * 10)  -- generates a random number between 0 and 1.

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);

floor - cuts of decimals
ceil - rounds up.

* 10  -- means up to 10 but not including.


// Math.random() returns a number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) --- so it will never return a number greater than 9.



to give a boolean querry to JS type:   var myVar "typof" = {};


//4  

function myFunction {
	var a = 1;
	return a'
}

or when you define a statement with a function - you do have to add a semi colon.

var myFunction = function() {
	var a = 1;
	return a;


	//write comments in your code - otherwise when you come back to it, you won't have any idea what you were doing//



};






var name = "bowman";
var color = "blue";
myRealSalary = "100";

var greeting = "My name is " + name + ".  My faborite collor is " + ".";


NEW STYLE:  String interpretation.

var greeting2 = 'My name is ${name}.  My faborite color is ${color}.''
I make about ${realSalary + 1000000}



using good variable names is key
